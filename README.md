# AZURE_AutoScaling
We've successfully implemented an auto-scaling virtual machine (VM) infrastructure, rigorously tested it with load simulations, and configured robust monitoring, alerting, and logging systems. This project ensures that our application dynamically scales resources, maintains high availability, and proactively addresses any performance or security issues, further enhancing the overall user experience and operational efficiency.

Key Highlights:
Auto-scaling VMs adapt to varying workloads, minimizing downtime and cost inefficiencies.
Load tests validate the infrastructure's ability to handle traffic spikes and fluctuations.
Continuous monitoring, alerts, and logs guarantee real-time insights, proactive issue resolution, and optimal resource allocation.
